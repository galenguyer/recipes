# Creamy Lemon Chicken

### Ingredients:
- 1/2 lb boneless skinless chicken breast
- 1 medium diced onion
- 4 cloves minced garlic
- 8 oz uncooked pasta
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup lemon juice
- 1 tsp lemon zest
- salt and pepper to taste

### Steps:
1. Cut chicken into bite-sized cubes. Add onion, garlic, and chicken, brown chicken in the pot.
2. Add in remaining ingredients. Bring pot to a boil, stirring to mix all ingredients. Keep lid partially open and cook at a medium boil for about 10-15 minutes, checking and stirring occasionally so that pasta does not stick to the bottom of your pot. 
3. When pasta is about finished, remove lid and let pasta continue to cook for about another 2-3 minutes, letting the sauce thicken and most of the liquid evaporate. (Make sure to watch pasta and don't let all the sauce completely evaporate.) Garnish with fresh parsley if desired before serving.
